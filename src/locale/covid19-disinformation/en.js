  CHAPTER_4: {
    HEADING: 'The Highest “Authorities”: Public Authority Action/Policy',
    P_1: 'The “authorities” look very persuasive, so disinformation speaks for authorities.

    QUOTE_3: ' “Russian President Putin released 500 lions on the streets to ensure people stay indoors.”',
    P_2: 'Besides fabricating policies of the government or authorities, disinformation in this type would even exaggerate the policies. Another feature is that it is easy to spread across borders. For example, fact-checking reports from at least 8 countries there is disinformation like “You will be fined or jailed without wearing a mask”; from at least 12 countries, Taiwan included, fact-checking reports contain disinformation like “The government will send helicopters spraying disinfectant, so do not go outside.”',
    P_3: '“In our fact-checking work, PolitiFact comes across claims about government control regularly. Before COVID19, most of these claims centered around gun control. There is long-standing suspicion of government intrusion in the United States,” Holan said.',
    P_4: 'It is mentioned in a research by Reuters Institute for the Study of Journalism: the large number of disinformation in this type could also indicate that governments have not always succeeded in providing clear, useful, and trusted information to address pressing public questions.

    P_2: 'Angie Holan, the editor-in-chief of PolitiFact, shared with us: “In our fact-checking work, PolitiFact comes across conspiracy theories regularly. They seem to have become a part of the American disinformation landscape. We\'ve seen many conspiracies before COVID19, and I expect to see more afterward.” She was not sure why there were so many conspiracy theories in the US, and said, “We know we have been targeted to some extent by outside governments, but we also seem susceptible to home-grown conspiracy theories as well.”',
    P_3: 'Conspiracy directly points out the origins of the epidemic. With the evolution of the epidemic, “the origins of the virus” begin to diversify:',
    P_4: 'It is worth noting that, compared with other types of disinformation, the conspiracy theory disinformation is not diverse, and most of them center around these topics. Even if they have been checked as a mistake, disinformation on the same topic have spread to different countries along with the epidemic.',
    P_5: 'For example, from January 29, the day that the IFCN CoronaVirusFacts Alliance Database was launched, disinformation like “Bill Gates is behind COVID-19”, “5G will spread COVID-19” had appeared. As we can see in the data, similar disinformation still there until May.',
    P_6: 'Summer Chen also mentioned: among all conspiracy theories, disinformation of “origins of virus” was commonly spread on Taiwanese social media, and it became a popular topic of late stage fact-check. According to the research by Doublethink Lab, it was the most often spread message apart from “masks”.',
    P_7: 'From Summer Chen’s observation, disinformation after March centered around 4 topics: the virus was man-made; the virus was made in lab; the virus was China’s bioweapon; the origin of the virus was either Wuhan or the US.',
    P_8: '“This type of disinformation is very tricky, because it is interspersed with scientific articles and seems to be confirmed by experts, but the cited research actually does not mention these things at all,” Chen indicated, “Or, disinformation will make use of language gaps, such as Japanese TV reports, US President Trump’s statement, Italian Minister of Health’s speech, etc.”',
    P_9: 'If coupled with the promotion of authority figures in real life, the rumors are even more credible. For example, we can see from the fact-checking reports that the former US Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and the former Iran President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad has publicly stated that “Coronavirus comes from the laboratory”; Taiwan’s political talk show has quoted a “Chinese research” from a disinformation, saying that the United States is the origin of the virus. The Weibo of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of PRC immediately shared and mentioned "Taiwanese media confirmed”, and so on.',
    P_10: '"Regarding the origin of the virus, it has become a political war of words." Chen said.'

  CHAPTER_6: {
    HEADING: 'What is Taiwan Lacking in Epidemic Prevention? Wipe Out Wrong Home Remedies',
    P_1: 'If we evaluate Taiwan\'s epidemic prevention performance by Taiwan\'s disinformation topics distribution, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) holds a daily press conference to keep the epidemic situation transparent, which obviously has an effect. Although the "exaggerated epidemic" disinformation ranks second, as we look closely at the content, only 5 scenes are set in Taiwan, and the rest are exaggerated foreign epidemic situations; compared with the high level of the type of "official institutions’ actions" in other countries, this type only ranks fourth in Taiwan, accounting for 12% of the total.',
    P_2: 'But the number one: "medical related" disinformation is clearly what Taiwan needs to reinforce. Chen mentioned, "From the rumors you can observe the poor knowledge of the public. Although the government and experts continue to promote knowledge about epidemic prevention, you can tell that people don’t fully understand, from the rumors prevailing during that time."',
    P_3: '“For example, it is correct that the virus may be hindered by high temperature. But it will be transformed by rumors,” Chen explained. Rumors will tell people to open the heater, drink hot water or take a hot spring bath, but none of these works. “Real knowledge is abstract, and the experts only said ‘the virus is not airborne transmitted’ but what does airborne transmitted mean? Rumors will take advantage when you don’t have enough real knowledge.”',
    P_4: {
      TEXT_1: 'In addition,  there is very little disinformation about “the epidemic is not serious” in Taiwan. According to the ',
      LINK: 'research conducted by Doublethink Lab',
      TEXT_2: ', disinformation of this type mainly appeared in January (that is, before the IFCN database was launched, so it is not within the scope of this READr research), and it is related to the operation of PR firms and the attack of Chinese information war.'
    },
    P_5: 'Taiwan is the first place outside China to receive the epidemic, and the entire society has experienced SARS in the past. "Before the first case was diagnosed, the atmosphere was already tense. The disinformation that ‘the epidemic is not serious’ is difficult to be accepted in Taiwan."',
    P_6: '"The disinformation differs in different countries, depending on the real situation in each country. Although officials say that the epidemic prevention policy is based on science, such science is very political." Chen took masks as an example, and the government will measure the materials and the epidemic situation, to advise people to "wear masks in the right place at the right time". For Taiwan, "right" refers to confined spaces and hospitals; but for foreign countries that have serious community infections, it is a completely different situation.',
    P_7: 'She takes masks as an example. For masks are in short supply in other countries, it is more useful to make their people think that masks should be left to medical staff, so there are a lot of messages about "wearing masks is useless"; but in Taiwan, we have implemented mask-rationing system very soon after the pandemic, and as the social consensus so far is that "masks are effective for epidemic prevention" from the past SARS experience. Disinformation like "wearing masks is useless" is impossible to spread in Taiwan.',
    P_8: '"In Taiwan, where supplies are relatively abundant, (fake) messages do not tell people ‘don’t wear masks’, but tell us "wearing masks everywhere." Chen said, but the fake message of "wearing masks everywhere" is difficult to be accepted abroad, "it\'s two extremes."'
  },
  CHAPTER_7: {
    HEADING: '”Such science is very political.”',
    P_1: 'Another conflict is that "reuse masks by steaming with electric pots" is promoted vigorously by Taiwan’s CECC, and it was checked by many international fact-checking organizations as disinformation. These reports mainly refer to the WHO guidelines that “medical masks cannot be reused”. ',
    P_2: 'In fact, reviewing the entire epidemic prevention process, in early time, Taiwan officials did not recommend reusing masks. Ms. Huang, the head of Research and Inspection team of the Food and Drug Administration, said that the policy change came from Minister Chen Shi-chung, who believed that it is good for everyone if the materials can be saved. He referred to scholars\' research, did experiments by himself and then confirmed that the bacterial filtration efficiency could still maintain the national standard, after the dry steaming procedure.',
    P_3: 'However, CECC still advises the public to reuse the dry-steamed mask for 3 to 5 times at most, and to discard it after visiting high-risk places. Also, the method is not recommended to practice for medical staff usage. Dr. Lai from the leading team of mask reuse research, the expert team of the Science Media Center, and the Department of Occupational Safety and Health at Chung Shan Medical University, said that there is such a proviso, because COVID-19 has not been directly tested, but only the virus with similar characteristics has been done. The filtration efficiency maintains the standard.',
    P_4: '"This is not for me to debunk," Chen said. The social context in which disinformation appears is very important. If Taiwan enters a serious stage of community infection, CECC may not recommend reusing the mask.'

    },
    P_3: 'The influence of disinformation in the type of "incidents caused by the epidemic" is obviously more powerful than other types. In the total statistics of fact-checking reports, this type of disinformation only accounts for 8% of the total, which is not much.',
    P_4: 'This type of disinformation is not directly related to COVID-19, but incidents caused by the epidemic. For example, many countries have stopped events and festivals due to the epidemic, allowing nature to return to peace; political struggles or criticisms among politicians; frauds that occur when the public needs supplies and detection, and so on.',
    P_5: 'For example, the first and second popular tweets that have been retweeted more than 300,000 times are a group of photos of dolphins appearing in the Venice canals after lockdown in Italy. However, it embezzled unrelated photos. These "good news" are obviously more popular in the world where the epidemic has been out of control. For example, another film that has been retweeted more than 60,000 times is a film about people in quarantine dancing on the balcony.',
    P_6: 'But it is not just joy that affects emotions. A doctor wiped tears sadly and said goodbye to the quarantined baby; the police arrested a person who violated home isolation; a black man was beaten up by Asians in China... The influence of these fake films should not be underestimated.'
